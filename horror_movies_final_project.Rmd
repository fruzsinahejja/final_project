In the final project, I will use a dataset containing horror movies and information based on their production and popularity, likeability.

##Reading the dataset
```{r}
horror_movies <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/refs/heads/main/data/2022/2022-11-01/horror_movies.csv") #Read from the TidyTuesday github page.
```
##Checking the structure of the dataset
```{r}
str(horror_movies)
```
#Exploratory data analysis
Firs a quick overview of all the variables
```{r}
summary(horror_movies)
```
##Creating and exploring the year variable
```{r}

```
